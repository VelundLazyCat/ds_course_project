Customer Churn Prediction Project

Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning and neural network models. The application provides a web-based interface using Streamlit, allowing users to upload customer data and receive churn predictions.

Features

Multiple classification models:

Random Forest Classifier

Logistic Regression Classifier

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier

Ensemble ML Classifier (Stacking)

Neural Network Classifier

Data preprocessing and normalization

Interactive web application for predictions

Dockerized environment for easy deployment

Installation and Usage

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url
cd customer-churn-prediction

2. Running with Docker

To build and run the application using Docker, execute the following command:

docker-compose up --build

This will start a Streamlit application available at http://localhost:8501.

3. Running without Docker

If you prefer to run the application without Docker:

pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry run streamlit run app.py

Application Usage

Upload a CSV file containing customer data.

Choose a classification model from the sidebar.

Click on "Predict" to get the churn prediction results.

Download the results as a CSV file.
